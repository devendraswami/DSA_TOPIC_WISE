Stack- 

Stack is a linear data Structure. 
Stack follows the LIFO(Last in First Out) 
                   or 
                 FILO (first in Last Out)

-> Real time application of stack is - 1. undo Operation -> ctrl+Z 
                                       2. To store recursive calls 

Abstract Data Type ->  
                    Most frequently operations which are used in stack are - 1. push() - insert the data in stack 
                                                                             2. pop() - delete the element from the stack. 


Function of Stack - 1. push() 
                    2. pop() - Delete the top Most element
                    3. peek() - Fetch the top most element from the stack 
                    4. search() - return the position of element from the upside. If the element is not preset in the stack the it will retun -1; 
                    5. empty() - return boolean value if the statck is empty it will return true else false
